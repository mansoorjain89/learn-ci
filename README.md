Mini project to learn CI

# Introduction:

CircleCI is a tool that defines an automated testing environment; getting a CircleCI badge that reads "Passed" on a repository indicates that the project code has passed all lint tests. 

CircleCI uses a YAML file to identify how you want your testing environment set up and what tests you want to run. On CircleCI 2.0, this file must be called config.yml and must be in a hidden folder called .circleci. On Mac files and folders whose names start with a period are treated as system files that are hidden from users by default.
